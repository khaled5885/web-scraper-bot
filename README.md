# web-scraper-bot
In this project we are going to use the Selenium library we are going to need to download Chromdriver and install it and we are using the time library to make a delay for the bot to not get detected.
We are going to use a web scraper test site (https://webscraper.io/test-sites) specifically "E-commerce site with pagination links".
